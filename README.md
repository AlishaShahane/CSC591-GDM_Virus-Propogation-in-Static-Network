# Virus-Propogation-in-Static-Network
## The notebook has implementation for the following,
  1. Analyze and understand a virus propagation model.
  2. Calculate the effective strength of a virus.
  3. Simulate the propagation of a virus in a network.
  4. Implement immunization policies to prevent a virus from spreading across a network.
